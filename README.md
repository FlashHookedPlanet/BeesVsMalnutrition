# BeesVsMalnutrition
This is our #SpaceApps2017 #SpaceApps #SpaceAppsExeter project comparing commercial beehive numbers with malnutrition data. We have used low-resolution crochet planet pattern to describe the data available and LED's controlled from an Arduino board to describe the beehive population and the malnutrition factor of countries in the data set. This is a beginning and could be generalised quite quickly.
